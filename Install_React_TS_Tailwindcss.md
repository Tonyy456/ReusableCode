# Overview

this sets up React.js, Typescript, Vite (Vue), and Tailwind CSS. This additionally requires some dependencies to be installed.  
tailwind css comes with prebuilt css templates that can be directly inserted into the project and it works smoothly.

# Steps
1. install dependencies.  
  node.js, vite
2. following installation here...  
 [tailwind installation link](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite)
3. install dependencies for tailwind css
  ```sh
  npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react
  ```
4. change postcss.config.js suffix '.js' to '.cjs'
  Experimental, but in some cases I needed to do this.
